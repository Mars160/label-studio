Collect a chat completions dataset using the [Interactive LLM backend](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend/tree/master/label_studio_ml/examples/llm_interactive). 

To use this template, you need to connect a Interactive LLM backend model to the Label Studio project. This model requires an OpenAI API key. For information on connecting an example model, see [Integrate Label Studio into your machine learning pipeline](/guide/ml).
